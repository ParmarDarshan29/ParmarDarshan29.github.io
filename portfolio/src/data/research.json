    "summary": "Pioneered the use of Explainable AI (XAI) in Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis to transform Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis into a transparent and trustworthy process. Identified a critical neurophysiological biomarker for PTSD: Beta Power Spectral Density in the Right Primary Motor Cortex, linking the disorder directly to heightened arousal and sensory impairments. Conducted a crucial Fairness Analysis on the diagnostic framework, exposing significant demographic biases across groups (sex, education) and establishing a necessity for equitable AI in psychiatric healthcare.",

    "title": "EEG Biomarkers for PTSD Diagnosis using Explainable AI (XAI)",
    "summary": "This research presents an interpretable machine learning framework for identifying neurobiological markers of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) using EEG data. The model integrates ElasticNet-based feature selection, multiple machine learning classifiers, and Explainable AI tools (SHAP, LIME, ELI5) to ensure clinical transparency and interpretability. The study demonstrates how EEG frequency-band activity and connectivity patterns can serve as objective biomarkers for PTSD, achieving high diagnostic accuracy while maintaining explainability. Key findings reveal that beta power in the right motor cortex and alpha-band connectivity between frontal and parietal regions significantly distinguish PTSD from healthy controls. This project contributes toward trustworthy, cost-effective, and interpretable AI solutions for mental health diagnostics.",

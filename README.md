I build meaningful, interpretable, and performance-focused AI and web experiences.

Hi I'm Darshan Parmar, a Computer Engineering student and AI enthusiast from Government Engineering College, Bharuch, affiliated with Gujarat Technological University. My work bridges Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Explainable AI (XAI) to create transparent and equitable intelligent systems — particularly in healthcare.

Focus
Explainable AI & Model Interpretability
EEG and Medical Image Analysis
Web & AI System Integration

Short Bio
I love transforming complex research ideas into real-world, accessible solutions. Currently, I’m researching interpretable PTSD diagnosis using EEG data and developing robust AI-driven healthcare tools that enhance clinical trust and decision-making.

Beyond AI, I’m interested in building sleek, performant web interfaces and exploring how design and data can work together to create better digital experiences.

Education
